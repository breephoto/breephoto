				<p>Welcome! My name is Bree,</p></p>
				<p>I grew up the beautiful Denver, Colorado :)  Life's unpredictable path has now landed me &amp; my camera in Sacramento. While I'll always be a Colorado girl, California has become a huge part of me!</p> 
				<p>I have always loved taking pictures, my friends might tell you I take way too many, but I cant help it! I've been pursuing photography professionally for about 5 years, focusing mostly on people &amp; 'lifestyle'. Thankfully my friends &amp; family have been wonderful subjects for me to practice on.  Capturing people in their true happiness, and creating memories they can appreciate forever is so important to me. </p>
				<p>I stuidied photography &amp; Photoshop editing at a studio in Mill Valley for about a year, other than that I am self taught and constantly learning from other Photographers who inspire me. Editing is my favorite part about the process! I love 're-living' the photoshoot, finding the most unique pictures and getting creative to bring out the best in the shot.</p>
				<p>Life is naturally imperfect, fun &amp; beautiful all in itself. I'm all about real life laughter and candid memories!</p>
